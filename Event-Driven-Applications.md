## Event Driven Applications

Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision. In this article we’re going to go over how Event-Driven Programming works and how we can make the best use of it in our Node.js projects.

Most developers are introduced to concepts of Event-Driven Programming early on in their study of programming yet they might not fully realize it until a bit later. You’ll find that the concept is rather ubiquitous. Check any major framework or software out there and odds are you’ll find evidence of Event-Driven Programming.
