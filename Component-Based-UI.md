# React

React
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

Component-Based
Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.

## JSX

JSX: it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like.

## The Virtual DOM

In React, for every DOM object, there is a corresponding “virtual DOM object.” A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object, like a lightweight copy.

A virtual DOM object has the same properties as a real DOM object, but it lacks the real thing’s power to directly change what’s on the screen.

Manipulating the DOM is slow. Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster, because nothing gets drawn onscreen. Think of manipulating the virtual DOM as editing a blueprint, as opposed to moving rooms in an actual house.

## Review

Software that renders HTML pages (Web pages). A browser rendering engine turns content coded in HTML into the text and images for the screen and printer. Also called a "layout engine," a rendering engine is used by Web browsers, email programs (for HTML email) and other applications that render HTML content. Following is a sampling of popular browsers and their rendering engines. See HTML, HTML email and render.

React components has a built-in state object. The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
