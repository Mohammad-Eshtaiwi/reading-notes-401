- What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?
  either the client or server can send a message to the other party whenever a message is available

- Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?

  Even when websockets can be used, the initial connection setup it done over HTTP. Also, a socket.io server will attach to an HTTP server so it can serve its own client code through /socket.io/socket.io.js.

- WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011, and the WebSocket API in Web IDL is being standardized by the W3C.

- socket.io. Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node. js.

- a client is a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server as part of the clientâ€“server model of computer networks. The server is often (but not always) on another computer system, in which case the client accesses the service by way of a network.

## socket.io

Sockets have traditionally been the solution around which most real-time chat systems are architected, providing a bi-directional communication channel between a client and a server.

This means that the server can push messages to clients. Whenever you write a chat message, the idea is that the server will get it and push it to all other connected clients.

A Namespace is a communication channel that allows you to split the logic of your application over a single shared connection.

Within each namespace, you can also define arbitrary channels that sockets can join and leave. These channels are called rooms.
