# Props and State

React components has a built-in state object. The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.

React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML That can pass from parent commponent to the child component.

npm run build creates a build directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favorite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served index.html, and requests to static paths like /static/js/main.<hash>.js are served with the contents of the /static/js/main.<hash>.js file. For more information see the production build section.

In software engineering, behavior-driven development (BDD) is an Agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project.It encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave.

ACCEPTANCE TESTING is a level of software testing where a system is tested for acceptability. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the systemâ€™s compliance with the business requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery.

The main job of React is to figure out how to modify the DOM to match what the components want to be rendered on the screen.

React does so by "mounting" (adding nodes to the DOM), "unmounting" (removing them from the DOM), and "updating" (making changes to nodes already in the DOM).
