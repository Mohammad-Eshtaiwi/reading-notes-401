## OAuth

OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.This mechanism is used by companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter to permit the users to share information about their accounts with third party applications or websites.

## review

- Why is authentication important?

Authentication is important because it enables organizations to keep their networks secure by permitting only authenticated users (or processes) to access its protected resources, which may include computer systems, networks, databases, websites and other network-based applications or services.

- Why should we be careful about storing a user’s password?

for ethical reasons and to prevent hackers access it

- What is the difference between hashing and encryption?

  Encryption is a two-way function; what is encrypted can be decrypted with the proper key. Hashing, however, is a one-way function that scrambles plain text to produce a unique message digest.

- What is the difference between encryption and encoding?

Encryption: Secure encoding of data used to protect confidentiality of data.

Encoding: Reversible transformation of data format, used to preserve usability of data.

- What is a token used for?

for API authentication mechanism.

## Terms

- Authentication: is the process of verifying the identity of a person or device.

- Authorization: is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to information security and computer security in general and to access control in particular. More formally, "to authorize" is to define an access policy.

- Encryption is the process of taking plain text, like a text message or email, and scrambling it into an unreadable format called “cipher text.

- Hashing: is the transformation of a string of characters into a usually shorter fixed-length value or key that represents the original string.

- Session: is defined as a series of related browser requests that come from the same client during a certain time period.

- Cookies: HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser.

- JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

- Basic Auth: in the context of an HTTP transaction, basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g. a web browser) to provide a user name and password when making a request.

- Encoding: Reversible transformation of data format, used to preserve usability of data.

- Cryptography: is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes, so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it.
