## Terms

- The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

- An event listener is a procedure or function in a computer program that waits for an event to occur. ... The term event listener is often specific to Java and JavaScript. In other languages, a subroutine that performs a similar function is referred to as an event handler.13‏/11‏/2018

- An event handler typically is a software routine that processes actions such as keystrokes and mouse movements. With Web sites, event handlers make Web content dynamic.

- event-driven programming is when a program is designed to respond to user engagement in various forms. It is known as a programming paradigm in which the flow of program execution is determined by “events.” Events are any user interaction, such as a click or key press, in response to prompt from the system.

- the event loop is a programming construct or design pattern that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program.

- Job Queue: Apart from Callback Queue, browsers have introduced one more queue which is “Job Queue”, reserved only for new Promise() functionality. So when you use promises in your code, you add .then() method, which is a callback method. These `thenable` methods are added to Job Queue once the promise has returned/resolved, and then gets executed.

- A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

## OSI

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual model created by the International Organization for Standardization which enables diverse communication systems to communicate using standard protocols. In plain English, the OSI provides a standard for different computer systems to be able to communicate with each other.

## TCP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation through which application programs can exchange data. TCP works with the Internet Protocol (IP), which defines how computers send packets of data to each other. Together, TCP and IP are the basic rules defining the Internet. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) defines TCP in the Request for Comment (RFC) standards document number 793.
