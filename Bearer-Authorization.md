- What can you do with an authorization code?

The authorization code is a temporary code that the client will exchange for an access token. The code itself is obtained from the authorization server where the user gets a chance to see what the information the client is requesting, and approve or deny the request.

- What can you do with an access token?

Access tokens are the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user. The access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user's data. Access tokens must be kept confidential in transit and in storage.

- What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?

more secure

- Client ID: The client_id is a public identifier for apps. Even though it’s public, it’s best that it isn’t guessable by third parties, so many implementations use something like a 32-character hex string. It must also be unique across all clients that the authorization server handles. If the client ID is guessable, it makes it slightly easier to craft phishing attacks against arbitrary applications.

- Client Secret The client_secret is a secret known only to the application and the authorization server. It must be sufficiently random to not be guessable, which means you should avoid using common UUID libraries which often take into account the timestamp or MAC address of the server generating it. A great way to generate a secure secret is to use a cryptographically-secure library to generate a 256-bit value and converting it to a hexadecimal representation.

- API Endpoint: Simply put, an endpoint is one end of a communication channel. When an API interacts with another system, the touchpoints of this communication are considered endpoints. For APIs, an endpoint can include a URL of a server or service. Each endpoint is the location from which APIs can access the resources they need to carry out their function.

## What is JSON Web Token?

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
