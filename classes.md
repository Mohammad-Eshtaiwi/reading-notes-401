## Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?

to add new capabilities to javascript for example to deal with the file system and HTTP.

## What is the difference between a module and a package?

the package is a group of modules that related to it and make do its functionality Also you can publish your package

## What does the node package manager do?

command-line utility for interacting with a said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management.

## Vocabulary

- Ecosystem: consists of the set of software solutions that enable, support, and automate the activities and transactions by the actors in the associated social or business ecosystem and the organizations that provide these solutions

- node: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command-line tools

- V8 Engine: V8 is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by The Chromium Project for Google Chrome and Chromium web browsers

- module: module is just a file. One script is one module. As simple as that.
- package: a package is a group of modules that related to it and make do its functionality

-node package manager: command-line utility for interacting with a said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management.

- server: server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients". This architecture is called the client-server model.

- Environment variables: are a fundamental part of developing with Node.js, allowing your app to behave differently based on the environment you want them to run in.

- Interpreter: An interpreter is a computer program, which coverts each high-level program statement into the machine code. This includes source code, pre-compiled code, and scripts. Both compiler and interpreters do the same job which is converting higher-level programming language to machine code. However, a compiler will convert the code into machine code (create an exe) before the program run. Interpreters convert code into machine code when the program is run.

- Compiler: A compiler is a special program that processes statements written in a particular programming language and turns them into machine language or "code" that a computer's processor uses.

## Test-driven development

Test Driven Development is a software development practice enabling developers to create proper specifications about how their code should be written and implemented. Fundamentally, TDD is a practice when a programmer writes a functional test before building a code.

### Why To Use It

1. Better program design and higher code quality
2. Detailed project documentation

## Context in JavaScript

Context is related to objects. It refers to the object to which a function belongs. When you use the JavaScript “this” keyword, it refers to the object to which function belongs.

# Classes

Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 classalike semantics.

## Inheritance

inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object (prototype-based inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), retaining similar implementation. Also defined as deriving new classes (sub classes) from existing ones such as super class or base class and then forming them into a hierarchy of classes.
