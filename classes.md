-   Interpreter: An interpreter is a computer program, which coverts each high-level program statement into the machine code. This includes source code, pre-compiled code, and scripts. Both compiler and interpreters do the same job which is converting higher-level programming language to machine code. However, a compiler will convert the code into machine code (create an exe) before the program run. Interpreters convert code into machine code when the program is run.

-   Compiler: A compiler is a special program that processes statements written in a particular programming language and turns them into machine language or "code" that a computer's processor uses.
